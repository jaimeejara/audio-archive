        <cd1>What is a CD?</cd1>
        <p>
            Compact Discs, or CDs, were first prototyped in 1979 and initially introduced to tech enthusiasts in Europe and Japan. A year later, electronics giants Philips and Sony joined forces to develop CDs for public use. They settled on a sleek, shiny circular disc capable of holding up to 80 minutes of music, designed to be played through a CD player.

            CDs became publicly available in 1982 and quickly became the go-to format for music storage. Unlike vinyl and cassette tapes, CDs offered the convenience of skipping directly to specific tracks—an innovation that appealed to many listeners.
        </p>  
        However, CD sales began to decline with the launch of iTunes in 2001, which allowed users to purchase and download music digitally. Despite this shift toward digital formats, CDs have seen a modest revival in the 21st century. Many music collectors and fans now appreciate CDs for their nostalgic charm and the tactile, analog experience they offer.

        <p>
            To help extend the life of your Compact Discs, keep them away from heat and direct sunlight, as excessive exposure can cause the disc to become misshapen or even melt. Always store your CDs in a cool, dark place, and avoid humid environments that can cause long-term damage. When handling CDs, be gentle—avoid bending them when taking them out of their cases. Make sure to store them upright in their designated cases when not in use. Proper storage also helps prevent scratches, which can interfere with playback and affect sound quality.
