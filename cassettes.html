        <cas1>What is a Cassette Tape?</cas1>
        <p>
            The Cassette Tape, or Compact Cassette, was created by the Philips company in Belgium in 1962. It made its public debut at the Berlin Radio Show on August 30, 1963, and reached the United States in November of the following year. Prior to its release, music was primarily played on vinyl—great for sound quality, but not exactly built for portability. The cassette tape changed that, offering a convenient way to take your music on the go.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Compact Cassette reached peak popularity in the 1980s but saw a sharp decline in the '90s with the rise of compact discs (CDs). Still, in recent years, cassettes have been making a quiet comeback.

        <cas1>Cassette Care & Storage</cas1>
        <p>
            Caring for your tapes is important as it extends the life time of the cassette and ensures it keeps it in good sounding shape. 
        </p>
        <cas2>
            Storing Your Tapes
        </cas2>
        <p>
            Avoid storing your cassette tapes in direct sunlight, as prolonged exposure can cause the plastic to become brittle or deformed due to heat. The repeated expansion and contraction from temperature changes can lead to damage—or in extreme cases, even cause the plastic to melt. It's also important to keep tapes away from water and humidity, as moisture can encourage mold growth and compromise the tape's ability to play properly. For best results, store your cassettes upright in a cool, dry space with stable temperatures, and avoid stacking them to help preserve their lifespan and performance.
        </p>
        <cas2>
            Handling Tapes
        </cas2>
        <p>
            Always handle your cassette tapes with clean hands, holding them by the edges of the outer casing to avoid touching the magnetic tape inside. Direct contact with the tape should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, as it can easily be damaged. If you do need to access the tape, use cotton gloves to help protect it from oils and scratches.
        </p>
        <cas2>
        Cleaning Your Cassette Tapes
        </cas2>
        <p>
            Ensure the tapes you use are not dirty and are clean as it can put heavy wear on the playback heads. Cassette playback heads are easily accessible and can be cleaned with 91% isopropyl alcohol and cotton swab. Just moisten the swab and gently clean away any dirt or grime that has built up on the playback heads.
        </p>
        <cas1>Tapedecks & Equipment</cas1>
        <p>
            A quality turntable and properly aligned cartridge are essential. Consider adding a preamp, good speakers, and vibration control for the best playback experience.
